[h1] Survival Tips [/h1]
[list]
  [*]Build a base (or drop Plot Sign). [b]Bases never decay[/b] (must be removed by user).
  [*]Protect your loot with a storage safe. Stores up to 40 items. Requires explosives to raid.
  [*]Carry Antibiotics (Alien venom remedy) which can be purchased in the safe zone.
  [*]Aliens spawn everywhere, including indoors. Be careful when searching loot.
  [*]Only melee Aliens in tight areas. In most cases, long rifles are preferred.
  [*]In many cases running (strafe left/right) is your best defense.

[h1] Known Issues [/h1]
[b] Inventory items (Vendor, Storage - Not backpacks) are messed up, or missing [/b]
This is due to a bug [i]in the Miscreated client[/i], not the workshop itself. When you connect from an existing i3D-hosted or third-party server the inventory cache gets corrupted. To mitigate this you need to connect to the game server using a new client session (i.e. launch game, connect to server).

That being said, I have created the module [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2790920967]Mods Directory Cleanup[/url] for this exact purpose.
