TITLE="D.O.A. â˜… Base Decay Disabler Mod"
DESCRIPTION=$(cat << EOF
While you cannot fully disable PlotSign decay, you can update the [i]AbandonTimer[/i] field in the game database when character actions occur.  This ensures that as long as any player accesses the game server within a 28 day window, the decay timeout [b]will be extended by another 28 days for ALL bases[/b] on the game server.

[h3] !!! IMPORTANT !!! [/h3]
Note, [b]the mod UGC can be removed at any time[/b] once the SQL trigger has been created.  If left enabled the process will be skipped until the SQL trigger has been removed from the database.

[h1] Compatibility [/h1]
This module only works with the [i]Windows 10[/i] operating system, non-emulated environment.

[h3] Manual install (for unsupported systems) [/h3]
